# Resume
[This here is my resume.](https://besartelezi.github.io/portfolio/) 
It's perfect place where employers will find out the reasons to hire me.
It will also be a small challenge for me coding wise.
I want to try out different things on Javascript that I'm not familiar with, mostly making animations.
It might also be a nice idea to have different pages on the resume.

Before starting out with the resume, I will make a list of things I'd like the resume to have, both coding and content wise.

## Content 
I have dabbled quite a bit with making resumes, be it for myself, or for friends and family.
But this will be the first time that I will make a resume website!

So I'll start out by writing down what pages I will add to the website and what kind of information that page should have.

### Homepage
This is where I will write down everything about me as a person. 
What you can do as a programmer is definitely important, but what kind of person you are is, to me, the most important thing.
I've read somewhere before that: 'Everyone can learn to be a good programmer, but not everyone can learn to be a good person'!

The page needs to have:
- [ ] A picture of 'le moi'
    - [x] Layout
    - [x] Content
    - [ ] Style
- [ ] A small introduction
    - [x] Layout
    - [x] Content
    - [ ] Style
- [ ] Why I want to work in IT
    - [x] Layout
    - [ ] Content
    - [ ] Style
- [ ] Obligatory BeCode Promotion Part of the Resume
    - [x] Layout
    - [ ] Content
    - [ ] Style
    - Links to other page on the website, where I talk a bit about some projects I have already made. 
    - Explain why this experience can differentiate me from other potential employees.

The BeCode part of the site will have this layout: 
![some-text](resources/images/becode-layout.jpg)

Then comes this segment:
- [ ] My personal skills
    - [x] Layout
    - [ ] Content
    - [ ] Style
    - Includes Language

Here comes the spicy part, and I shall call this creation the 'Professional SkillBox':
- [ ] professional skills
  - [ ] Create a box, where all my skills are in.
  - [ ] The words need to be jumbled all together without order
  - [ ] Constantly move randomly
  - [ ] The colour keeps changing without stopping
  - [ ] Clicking/hovering over a word, lets it grow, and it stays in place.
  - [ ] When clicking on a button, all words in the box will be ordered perfectly and the page visitor can read them in a more calm way.
    - [ ] If possible, have it animated so the visitor can see the words run to their respective positions from their random ones, while also changing colours/sizes if needed.
  - Link to GitHub, so the employers can see for their selves if my current programming/coding abilities lie where they desire.

I have never made something like the Professional SkillBox, and I'd like to keep evolving it.
I might even need to use OOP for this if necessary.


### Experience
- [ ] My education/work experiences
    - [ ] Layout
    - [ ] Content
    - [ ] Style

### Coding/Projects/Programming Page (Still unsure of the title bit I'll get there)
At the start of the page, immediately link to my GitHub.
This page will contain some screenshots of projects I made, some text describing the projects, and links to the GitHub repositories and the projects themselves.
The projects I want to show off are:

- [ ] The Pokédex
  - What can I say, I just love Pokémon
- [ ] WeCode
  - It was a group project of a website for a fictional company.
- [ ] Cookie Clicker
- [ ] Blackjack on JS
- [ ] Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

### Contact Page
This is where employers can find all my contact information.

- [ ] I'd like to add an e-mail form here.
- [ ] Show my e-mail address, phone number, the city I live in, that I have a temporary license B (I can drive by myself, I just still need to take the practical exam), maybe add social media links as well.

## To Code or Not To Code, That's Not Even a Good Question Of Course I Need To Code What Else Am I Getting Paid For?
Here are some things I'd like the resume website to have.
These things can change over time of course.
I might add some new things, remove/rewrite some old ones, I think it's important to remain adaptable and open to all the possibilities.

- [ ] **R E S P O N S I V E**
- [ ] Light and Dark Mode
  - Because I just love dark mode.
- [ ] Animations
  - Because I just love anime.
- [ ] Language button
  - The user can only select English and Dutch, since those are the languages I'm most fluent in.

### Header
Links to the different pages, but make it *r e s p o n s i v e*!
It also needs to have a light/darkmode switch button.
### Footer
Copyright by Besart Elezi.
I will also research other footers and see what I can add here.
* Social Links/Link to Github
* Let the user switch between Dutch and English.

## Goodbye preparation, hello actually making stuff!
With my lil' to do list done, I can finally focus on making the resume itself.
The very first thing I did was look for what colours I'd like to use for the website itself.
I know that I want to have a dark and light mode, so I chose these two colours just to start with:
* Ivory: #f6f7eb
* Onyx: #393e41
* Charleston Green: #26292C
